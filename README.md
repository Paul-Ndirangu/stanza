# stanza Project

[Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) is a collection of accurate and efficient tools for the linguistic analysis of many human languages. Starting from raw text, Stanza divides it into sentences and words, and then can recognize parts of speech and entities, do syntactic analysis, and more. Stanza brings state-of-the-art NLP models to languages of your choosing.

## Stanza features:
* Native Python implementation requiring minimal efforts to set up;
* Full neural network pipeline for robust text analytics, including tokenization, multi-word token (MWT) expansion, lemmatization, part-of-speech (POS) and morphological features tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition;
* Pretrained neural models supporting 70 (human) languages;
* A stable, officially maintained Python interface to CoreNLP.
